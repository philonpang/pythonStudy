107	ActionSwift3		172		17		https://github.com/craiggrummitt/ActionSwift3.git		AS3 SDK in Swift		![ActionSwift logo](https://github.com/craiggrummitt/ActionSwift3/blob/master/ActionSwift.png)  Swift is awesome - but do you ever reminisce about the old days of ActionScript 3.0? The old days of MovieClips, DisplayObjects, Sprites, SimpleButtons, EventDispatchers - oh and who can forget gotoAndPlay? Well, now you can enjoy iOS native development using the power of Swift syntax but with the AS3 SDK! Whaa? How is this possible? Is this heresy? **ActionSwift3**Underneath the hood ActionSwift3 is based on the SpriteKit Framework but ActionSwift 3 SDK is based on familiar AS3 SDK classes:*   DisplayObject*   InteractiveObject*   DisplayObjectContainer*   Sprite*   Graphics*   Stage*   MovieClip*   SimpleButton*   TextField*   TextFormat*   Sound*   SoundChannel*   EventDispatcher*   Event*   EventHandler*   Touch*   TouchEvent (in a touch environment TouchEvent makes more sense to use than MouseEvent)Easing classes are also included for convenience from [here](https://github.com/craiggrummitt/SpriteKitEasingSwift).API documentation can be found at [cocoadocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/ActionSwift3/)## InstallationActionSwift is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/ActionSwift3). To installit, simply add the following line to your Podfile:```rubypod "ActionSwift3"```Don't forget to import the Pod where you would like to use it:```Swiftimport ActionSwift3```Alternatively, if you would like access to the example project as well, clone the github project [here](https://github.com/craiggrummitt/ActionSwift3).**ActionSwift**ActionSwift is a sample project that you can use to play with ActionSwift3. Start with taking a look at GameViewController.swift. GameViewController does the following:1. Sets up the stage.2. Creates a 'play' sprite that draws a circle containing a triangle.3. Creates a 'stop' sprite that draws a rectangle containing a rectangle.4. Creates a movieclip that displays textures defined by an array of strings referring to the images in the folder 'images.atlas'. 5. Shows how to create an event listener by setting up clicks on all three sprites. The stop and play sprites 'stop' and 'play' the movieclip. Touching the movieclip activates a drag-drop operation.![Screenshot](https://github.com/craiggrummitt/ActionSwift3/blob/master/screenshot.png)**How to use ActionSwift3**Here is some sample code to get your head around how to use ActionSwift3.***Stage***To begin with, you need to set up the Stage in a ViewController that contains a SKView(this is done for you automatically if you set up a Game-SpriteKit project)```Swiftlet stage = Stage(self.view as! SKView)```***Sprite***You can now call familiar methods on the stage. For example, you could instantiate a sprite, and draw a rectangle on its graphics property, and then add this sprite to the stage:```Swiftlet sprite = Sprite()sprite.graphics.beginFill(UIColor.redColor())sprite.graphics.drawRect(10,10,100,44)sprite.name = "shapes"stage.addChild(sprite)```***MovieClip***To create a movieclip, you will need images within a folder with the extension 'atlas' in your project (eg.'images.atlas'). This will automatically generate a Texture Atlas. Set up an array of these image file names, and pass them in when you instantiate a MovieClip. These will now be the 'frames' of your movieclip, which you will be able to call familiar methods - gotoAndPlay(), gotoAndStop(), stop() and play(). Use Stage.size to get the dimensions of the device. Oh and x=0, y=0 is the top left of the stage. Hooray!```Swiftlet walkingTextures = ["walking1","walking2","walking3"]let movieClip = MovieClip(textureNames: walkingTextures)movieClip.x = 0movieClip.y = Stage.size.height - movieClip.heightstage.addChild(movieClip)```**SimpleButton**You can create a SimpleButton object, with an up and down state(not much point of over states on touch screens!) You can use sprites(with shapes on the graphics object) or movieclips(with textures) as the states.```Swiftlet play = SimpleButton(upState: playUpState, downState: playDownState)stage.addChild(sprite)```***TextField***Use familiar syntax to create a textfield. Build the basics of the textfield using the TextField class, and then apply text formatting to the defaultTextFormat property, using the TextFormat class.```Swiftlet text = TextField()text.width = 200text.text = "Salutations to you, world"let textFormat = TextFormat(font: "ArialMT", size: 20, leading: 20, color: UIColor.blackColor(), align:.Center)text.defaultTextFormat = textFormatstage.addChild(text)```***Sound***Use sound to play sounds included in your project - a big difference though - now wav files are supported as well as mp3. *Hooray!* Loop the audio, or play it from a point in the file. As per the strange AS3 API, use SoundChannel to stop the sound.```Swiftsound = Sound(name: "ButtonTap.wav")sound.play()```***EventDispatcher***Just as you would expect, Sprites, SimpleButtons and MovieClips will dispatch events. As Swift is not able to check equality between two functions, an additional class called 'EventHandler' stores the EventHandler, along with a string representing the EventHandler, that can be checked for equality. For example, here's how to set up an enterFrame event handler:```SwiftmovieClip.addEventListener(EventType.EnterFrame.rawValue, EventHandler(enterFrame, "enterFrame"))func enterFrame(event:Event) -> Void {    trace("This is called every frame")}```***trace***Oh yeah - and trace is back!```Swifttrace("This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen, trace is back! How did they do this?")```**Enhancements**ActionSwift3 is a work in progress, feel free to contribute! Ideas for enhancements:*   Date*   XML*   Add more complex shapes on Graphics**Updates**1.1*   Added int and Boolean data types1.2*   Added TextField*   Resolved issue with stage updates not propogating*   Added license1.3*   Added SimpleButton*   Added UIColor extension for hexidecimal support1.4*   Added Sound, SoundChannel1.5*   Updated for Swift 2***Credits****   "Walking animation" by [Kyoux](http://kyoux.deviantart.com/)*   "ActionScript" by Adobe Systems Inc.*   "Swift" by Apple Inc.*   "Swift logo" by Apple Inc.

Otherwise you might get wrong size in popoverPresentedSize._    ``` objective-c    [popoverController insertContentIntoPopover:^(ARSPopover *popover, CGSize popoverPresentedSize, CGFloat popoverArrowHeight) {        CGFloat originX = 0;        CGFloat originY = 0;        CGFloat width = popoverPresentedSize.width;        CGFloat height = popoverPresentedSize.height - popoverArrowHeight;        CGRect frame = CGRectMake(originX, originY, width, height);        UIWebView *webView = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];        webView.scalesPageToFit = YES;        [webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://google.com"]]];        [popover.view addSubview:webView];    }];    ```## LicenseARSPopover is released under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

It uses your provided UIView objects to perform animations.![ARSSlideTransition](http://git.arsenkin.com/ARSSlideTransition.gif)## Installation### CocoaPodsTo install with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/), copy and paste this in your *.pod* file:    platform :ios, '7.0'    pod 'ARSSlideTransition', '~> 1.0'### Non-CocoaPods wayYou can always to do the old way - just drag the source files into your projects and you are good to go.## Usage### Prepare your classesIn order to prepare your views for animation, you have to configure your UIViewControllers to support custom transition:###### Presenting view controller1. Make sure, that in your view, that contains elements you wish to animate, you have set `clipsToBounds` property to `NO`. This will allow animate these elements outside of the view's bounds.2. Import `ARSSlideTransition.h` and conform to protocols `UINavigationControllerDelegate` and `ARSSlideTransitionProtocol````objective-c@interface TableViewController () <UINavigationControllerDelegate, ARSSlideTransitionProtocol>```3. Implement `ARSSlideTransitionProtocol`'s required `objectsToAnimate` method. It should return `NSArray` of UIView class/subclass objects, that you wish to animate. **Order matters** - objects are going to be animated in the same order as they are presented in array.4. Set your presenting viewController as a delegate for navigationController```objective-cself.navigationController.delegate = self;```5. Implement `UINavigationControllerDelegate` method, to let iOS know, that custom transition would be used instead of the default one:```objective-c(id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)navigationController:(UINavigationController *)navigationController animationControllerForOperation:(UINavigationControllerOperation)operation fromViewController:(UIViewController *)fromVC toViewController:(UIViewController *)toVC {ARSSlideTransition *transition = [ARSSlideTransition new];transition.operation = operation;return transition;}```###### Presented view controller1.  Import `ARSSlideTransition.h` and conform to `ARSSlideTransitionProtocol` protocol.2. Implement `ARSSlideTransitionProtocol`'s required method.## Customizing animationIn case you specify only those three lines of code from step 4 in the section above, then default animation parameters are going to be used.In order to provide your custom tweaks or configurations to animation's behavior, you are able to use these properties:* `pushAnimationDuration` - specify presenting view controller's animation duration.```objective-ctransition.pushAnimationDuration = 0.45; // Default.```* `dismissAnimationDuration` - specify presented view controller's animation duration.```objective-ctransition.dismissAnimationDuration = 0.45; // Default```* `springDamping` - specify spring damping ratio for spring animation.```objective-ctransition.springDamping = 0.8; // Default```* `springVelocity` - specify spring velocity ratio for spring animation.```objective-ctransition.springVelocity = 0.8; // Default```* `initialDelay` - specify initial delay, after which animation transition will be launched.```objective-ctransition.initialDelay = 0.0; // Default```* `elementDelay` - specify delay for animating each following view element.```objective-ctransition.elementDelay = 0.05; // Default```* `viewDelay` - specify delay for animating presented view controller's elements.```objective-ctransition.viewDelay = 0.15; // Default```* `presentingViewAnimationOption` - specify animation option for presenting view.```objective-ctransition.presentingViewAnimationOption = UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseOut; // Default```* `presentedViewAnimationOption` - specify animation option for presented view.```objective-ctransition.presentedViewAnimationOption = UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseOut; // Default```## LicenseARSSlideTransition is released under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

The AsyncImageView operates independently of the UIImage cache, but by default any images located in the root of the application bundle will be stored in the UIImage cache instead, avoiding any duplication of cached images.  The library can also be used to load and cache images independently of a UIImageView as it provides direct access to the underlying loading and caching classes.

882	ATExpressiveCollections		2		0		https://github.com/andreyvit/ATExpressiveCollections.git		NSArray and NSDictionary categories that help you write more expressive code.		    Rationale, in 3 simple claims:    1. There are 3 types of code:        * Algorithmic / data structure-heavy code (e.g. create an empty array with the given capacity, iterate over the input collection, perform a test on each element, add the elements passing the test to the output array)        * API-heavy code (e.g. get a file manager, ask for the properties of the given resources, check for errors)        * Domain logic (e.g. ignore missing files)    2. It's a bad idea to mix these types of code in a single method.    3. So when you find yourself writing multiple lines of collection fiddling code and multiple lines of API interaction/domain logic code in the same method, you should extract the algorithmic parts into a separate helper method.    ATExpressiveCollections is a bunch of algorithmic helpers extracted from my apps over a long period of time.

You can control where the progress indicator goes (top/bot/left/right), the view grayness and cover view's grayness/opacity. If you're showing the HUD with the keyboard up (for example), you can move the HUD's center.Usage:    // Keep a strong ivar reference to it (ie, "ATMHud *hud")	hud = [ATMHud new]; // using the block delegate	[hud setCaption:@"Caption and an activity indicator."];	[hud setActivity:YES];	hud.blockDelegate = ....; // see demo project	[hud showInView:self.view];	...

BCOValueObject is an abstract class for implementing value objects. BCOValueObject provides equality checking and uniquing and optionally support for mutable variants. BCOValueObject places the following restrictions on its subclasses: - Direct subclasses can only include readonly properties. These properties should only be set by the designated initializer. Direct subclasses are referred to as 'immutable variants'. - Immutable variants are thread safe. - Immutable variants may be subclassed to create 'mutable variants'. Mutable variants have the following restrictions:    - Mutable variants must not add properties (direct ivars can be added but this is strongly discouraged).    - Mutable variants should not be subclassed.    - Setter declarations for mutable variants must be listed in a category. Implementations for setters will be automatically generated for most types. If a setter cannot be generated then an exception will be raised when the class is initialized. Setters which cannot be generated must be implemented like so:        -(void)setTransform:(CATransform3D)transform        {            [self setValue:[NSValue valueWithCATransform3D:transform] forKey:@"transform"];        }      BCOValueObject overrides setValue:forKey: so that it will not cause an infinite loop when being called from within a setter providing that the class hierarchy requirements listed above are adhered to.  - Mutable variants must be registered so that immutable variant can make mutable copies. The simplest way to do this is to call BCO_VALUE_OBJECT_REGISTER_MUTABLE_VARIANT from within the header file where the mutable variant is declared.  Due to the subclassing restrictions protocols should be used to implement polymorphism.

1318	BKSlidingViewController		2		2		https://github.com/Basket/BKSlidingViewController.git		A side-scrolling view controller container class with a minimal, UITabBarController-like API.		                       UIPageViewController seems somewhat rigidly designed for paginated content, and is very efficient at lazily instantiating many view controllers with a particular pattern (before/after) and specific spatial metaphors. While it can do many things well, customization is ultimately limited by permissible alterations of the UIPageViewController class.                       BKSlidingViewController is an open-source substitute for applications desiring view controllers laid out horizontally, presented with a UITabBarController-like API.
1319	BkTask		86		9		https://github.com/Backelite/BkTask.git		An asynchronous workflows library for iOS		                    BkTask is a library inspired by the [Proactor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactor_pattern "Proactor pattern on Wikipedia")                     and [Reactor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern "Reactor pattern on Wikipedia") design patterns.                     It is designed with two concepts in mind, asynchronous and modular.                      Doing work asynchronously allows to keep your application responsive.                     But parallel programming is hard. On iOS, tools like GCD and NSOperation makes it much simpler but,                     for complex workflows it still takes time and resources to achieve.                     BkTask allows you to simply run workflows in background and be notified once it is done.                      What about modularity then ? One way to simply a complex task is to breaking it into multiple simple steps.                     That is how you build a task with BkTask, by adding the steps you need to complete your workflow.                     If your workflow changes, add or remove steps to update it. You can even create your own steps and reuse them in different workflows.                     The modular aspect of BkTask helps you to stay agile.                    On the technical side, it is built using technologies like NSOperation and key-value observing.                      This library is already used in AppStore applications used by millions of people.

1328	BlindsidedStoryboard		10		4		https://github.com/briancroom/BlindsidedStoryboard.git		A storyboard subclass which enables injecting dependencies into view controllers using Blindside.		Storyboards make dependency injection of view controllers challenging, because they insist on instantiating the view controllers internally. This restriction can be worked around by subclassing UIStoryboard and overriding the -instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier: method to perform configuration work immediately following the instantiation. The same storyboard instance that is used to create the initial view controller will be used to instantiate further view controllers accessed via segues.This pod provides a BlindsidedStoryboard subclass of UIStoryboard which exemplifies this technique, integrating with the Blindside DI framework. It also contains a small sample app demonstrating how this could be used.

It means that if the doc gets transferred to a Mac without your app installed, with the bundle bit still intact, it will still appear in the Finder as a file package rather than a folder.  *   If the document moves on disk, Core Data is kept informed of the new location.  *   If multiple validation errors occur during saving, the presented error is adjusted to make debugging a little easier.  *   And of course, full support for Autosave-In-Place and Versions.

The control is intended to be a drop-in replacement as far as possible.                   Segments can be packed horizontally or vertically, or into rows in an                    order-preserving manner, or a more space-efficient manner which may                    reorder the segments.

Simple, easy and very powerful way to use context and dependency injection and interception for Objective-C development. CDI is designed to solve some common software development patterns like Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control, Singleton and Interception (an minimalistic AOP approach).					The main features are:					* Injection by annotation					* Component auto-wiring					* Manual object binding					* Singleton by annotation					* Interception by annotation					Using CDI will reduce the boilerplate code in many classes, increase readability and allow better testing. The intreception functionality will also provide the ability to separate the implementation code by aspects like security, logging and other facets.					CDI does not depend on another framework, which means you can use any unit testing, mocking or other framework (see Limitation chapter).

While it does not inherit UIProgressView, its API is quite similar.                  The view is graphically very simple, consisting of only a background circle and a coloured arc:                  ![A CERoundProgressView on its own](http://www.ceroce.com/github/CEProgressView/ProgressViewAlone.png)                  However, used in conjunction with other elements, it becomes quite interesting. For example, the sample program uses it as the background of a button which uses an image, transparent in some parts:                  ![A CERoundProgressView used with a button](http://www.ceroce.com/github/CEProgressView/ProgressViewWithButton.png)                  ### Particular Features ###                  * The change of progress is animated.                  * Colours can be set, either individually or through the UIAppearance proxy.                  ## How to use ##                  Drag the following files to your Xcode project:                  * CERoundProgressView.h and .m                  * CERoundProgressLayer.h and .m                  Because the progress view uses Core Animation, your target must also link with the QuartzCore framework.                  ### Duration of the animation ###                  I could not find a way to add a custom animatable property to a UIView. As a result, the following sample code has no effect on the animation's duration:                    [UIView animateWithDuration:3.0 animations:^{                      self.roundProgressView.progress = 12.0;                    }];                  Therefore, CERoundProgressView an animationDuration property was added for that purpose.                  ## Compatibility ##                  CERoundProgressView is compatible with iOS 5 and iOS 6.                  #### Automatic Reference Counting ####                  ARC is not enabled in the sample project, and the classes manage memory the old way.                  If ARC is activated in your project, the compiler will complain about the -dealloc method in CERoundProgressLayer.m. You should disable ARC for this file using the -fno-objc-arc compiler flag.                  #### Older SDKs ####                  CERoundProgressView makes use of the UIAppearance API which is only available from iOS 5.0. Should you want to link with older SDKs, you may modify CERoundProgressView.h so the class does not conform to the UIAppearanceContainer protocol, and its properties are not declared as UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR.                  ## Sample project ##                  The sample program shows a button which toggles between Play and Pause. The CERoundProgressView is below it.                  * CEPlayer is the most interesting class. It makes its position evolve from 0 to 1 on a duration of 20 seconds. The position changes abruptly every 0.5 s, on purpose: you can notice that the slider jumps from value to value, while the progress view animates smoothly.                  * CEViewController is the delegate of CEPlayer. Its  purpose is to catch the actions of the button and set the progress of the slider and the progress view.

1788	CGLMediaPicker		7		2		https://github.com/chrisladd/CGLMediaPicker.git		The easiest way to let users get images into your app, handling permissions, the camera, and the photo library.		                       CGLMediaPicker allows the user to choose a piece of multimedia of an array of types provided by the client, and runs a completion block once the user has either successfully chosen, or cancelled for some reason. Influenced by ClusterPrePermissions, with the goal of being lighter weight, and generally allowing clients to be more hands off.                      It takes care of all permissions and UI, and is automatically retained in memory for as long as the user is actively choosing. There is no need for clients to maintain a reference.                      It takes care of presenting the right photo picker or camera components. It takes care of asking for permissions, informing the user why permissions are lacking, when they're lacking, and sends them to Settings.app to take care of any problems they might need to.                      In short, CGLMediaPicker lets you, the client, say: I would like the user to give me a piece of media. And then lets you sit back and wait for that media to arrive.
1789	CGLTextViewContainer		3		0		https://github.com/chrisladd/CGLTextViewContainer.git		CGLTextViewContainer is the guts of JTSTextView, fixing UITextView by laying out on one, big screen.		                           CGLTextViewContainer is a lighweight version of Jared Sinclair's excellent workaround to UITextView's notorious update problems.                                                    It's pretty much just wholesale stolen, but it differs in a few ways: it trusts clients enough to grant them access to the internal text view, cutting the amount of code                        needed by about half. Has-a vs. is-a or pretends-to-be-a. It allows configuration of the text container's height. And it takes into account measurements of the text view's                        inset.                                                   Original source here:                           https://github.com/jaredsinclair/JTSTextView                                                   Hopefully, iOS 9 will continue the long chain of text improvements on iOS and we won't need these shenanigans anymore.

2122	ConnectSDK		58		21		https://github.com/ConnectSDK/Connect-SDK-iOS.git		Connect SDK is an open source framework that connects your mobile apps with multiple TV platforms.		Connect SDK is an open source framework that connects your mobile apps with multiple TV platforms. Because most TV platforms support a variety of protocols, Connect SDK integrates and abstracts the discovery and connectivity between all supported protocols.To discover supported platforms and protocols, Connect SDK uses SSDP to discover services such as DIAL, DLNA, UDAP, and Roku's External Control Guide (ECG). Connect SDK also supports ZeroConf to discover devices such as Chromecast and Apple TV. Even while supporting multiple discovery protocols, Connect SDK is able to generate one unified list of discovered devices from the same network.To communicate with discovered devices, Connect SDK integrates support for protocols such as DLNA, DIAL, SSAP, ECG, AirPlay, Chromecast, UDAP, and webOS second screen protocol. Connect SDK intelligently picks which protocol to use depending on the feature being used.For example, when connecting to a 2013 LG Smart TV, Connect SDK uses DLNA for media playback, DIAL for YouTube launching, and UDAP for system controls. On Roku, media playback and system controls are made available through ECG, and YouTube launching through DIAL. On Chromecast, media playback occurs through the Cast protocol and YouTube is launched via DIAL.To support the aforementioned use case without Connect SDK, a developer would need to implement DIAL, ECG, Chromecast, and DLNA in their app. With Connect SDK, discovering the three devices is handled for you. Furthermore, the method calls between each protocol is abstracted. That means you can use one method call to beam a video to Roku, 3 generations of LG Smart TVs, Apple TV, and Chromecast.

2146	CordovaPlugin-camera		223		345		https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera.git		Cordova Camera Plugin		                   This plugin provides an API for taking pictures and for choosing images from the system's image library.                                      The camera.getPicture function opens the device's default camera application that allows users to snap pictures. This behavior occurs by default, when Camera.sourceType equals Camera.PictureSourceType.CAMERA. Once the user snaps the photo, the camera application closes and the application is restored.                                      If Camera.sourceType is Camera.PictureSourceType.PHOTOLIBRARY or Camera.PictureSourceType.SAVEDPHOTOALBUM, then a dialog displays that allows users to select an existing image. The camera.getPicture function returns a CameraPopoverHandle object, which can be used to reposition the image selection dialog, for example, when the device orientation changes.                                      The return value is sent to the cameraSuccess callback function, in one of the following formats, depending on the specified cameraOptions:                                      A String containing the base64-encoded photo image.                                      A String representing the image file location on local storage (default).                                      You can do whatever you want with the encoded image or URI, for example:                                              Render the image in an <img> tag, as in the example below                                              Save the data locally (LocalStorage, Lawnchair, etc.)                                              Post the data to a remote server                                              NOTE: Photo resolution on newer devices is quite good. Photos selected from the device's gallery are not downscaled to a lower quality, even if a quality parameter is specified. To avoid common memory problems, set Camera.destinationType to FILE_URI rather than DATA_URL.

There are already a number of parsers available in the wild, why should you use this one?                      * Compared to ParseKit:                        * CoreParse supports more languages (LR(1) languages cover all LL(1) languages and more).  In practice, LALR(1) grammars cover most useful languages.                        * CoreParse produces faster parsers.                        * CoreParse parsers and tokenisers can be archived using NSKeyedArchivers to save regenerating them each time your application runs.                        * CoreParse's parsing algorithm is not recursive, meaning it could theoretically deal with much larger hierarchies of language structure without blowing the stack.                      * Compared to lex/yacc or flex/bison:                        * While I have no explicitly benchmarked, I would expect parsers produced by lex/yacc or flex/bison to be faster than CoreParse ones.                        * CoreParse does not _require_ you to compile your parser before you start (though it is recommended).                        * CoreParse provides allows you to specify grammars right in your Objective-C source, rather than needing another language, which intermixes C/Obj-C.                        * CoreParse does not use global state, multiple parser instances can be run in parallel (or the same parser instance can parse multiple token streams in parallel).

CoreParse                      =========                      CoreParse is a parsing library for Mac OS X and iOS.  It supports a wide range of grammars thanks to its shift/reduce parsing schemes.  Currently CoreParse supports SLR, LR(1) and LALR(1) parsers.                      For full documentation see http://beelsebob.github.com/CoreParse.

CottonObject allows a developer to take the NSDictionary response and quickly wrap it in a formal Objective-C class. This has a number of benefits:                            * Because the object uses NSDictionary as the data store, it can be easily de/serialized using the NSCoding protocol.                            * Objects can be "faked" with dictionaries instanced from plists if your network or API is not up yet.                            * Provides type-safe getters and setters to the dictionary. Missing or wrongly keyed values return nil and as long as your code supports that (it awlays should), you'll avoid crashes when your web endpoint results change unexpectedly.                            * The property names are used as keys, eliminating the need for declaring string constants.

This functionality was previously not possible with Apple's provided `UIActionSheet` class, as the action sheet would capture the touch events of its subviews, despite the touches occuring outside of the action sheet's buttons.                     Example uses for this custom UIActionSheet would be to include more functionality to your action sheet than just providing a message with "OK" and "Cancel" buttons: adding a UIDatePicker, adding other selectors, or adding switches are just the beginning of what you could do with this new action sheet.                     Ultimately, what sets this implementation apart from other solutions out on the web is that it uses as much built-in functionality from Apple as much as possible, instead of the approach several other solutions out on the internet took by rolling out code that merely mimics the UIActionSheet's functionality.

[DBAccess] is a fully featured and FREE to use ORM for iOS.Replace CoreData whilst keeping your existing managed objects, but dump the predicates and long-winded syntax.Instead use a simple and clean object syntax, with fast and concise inline queries.DBAccess even has a conversion method to migrate your existing CoreData tables across.Regularly updated and in constant use within many public applications it thrives on feedback from other developers and is supported by the authors via StackOverflow or directly via email.Its mantra is simple, to be fast, simple to implement and the first choice for any developer.FEATURESTables are automatically modelled from your classes for the simplest of upgrade paths, you add a property, it adds the column.  Completely thread-safe in every scenario. Simple, powerful and flexible event model allows you to bind UI updates with anything that is happening to the database and best of all, is the use of standard SQLite syntax for the query conditions. Plus far too much to fit on this page.WHY SHOULD I USE [DBAccess] ?An ORM should not be a chore to work with, or require you to change your way of working to compensate for its shortcomings.   With [DBAccess] you simply add it to your project and start using it straight away.The developer has full control over how the ORM operates, deciding where it puts its files, how queries are performed and on which thread.  Objects can be managed or unmanaged, whilst being members of domains which may share changes or be isolated from them.If memory is a concern, you can mix and match lightweight objects to preserve system resources when you are expecting large result sets, or retrieve only the properties you need with the remainder being lazily loaded when accessed.HEADLINE FEATURESAutomatic modelling and upgrading from your class structures.Amazingly simple FLUENT interface for dealing with the ORMKILLER event model, for individual objects or tables.  Makes coding apps a breezeInline or Async queriesTransaction supportManaged and unmanaged objects supported to be used however you wantRelationships mirror your class structures automatically, and all relationships are automatically indexedProperty level encryption so databases remain human readable whilst securing individual columns.

2773	DMAutoInvalidation		0		1		https://github.com/jmah/DMAutoInvalidation.git		Block-based observers that automatically unregister themselves.		                   The DMAutoInvalidation class provides behavior to attach an                   observer object to an owning object. When the owning object                   is *about to* deallocate, `-invalidate` is sent to the                   observer object.                   This library includes pre-built observers for NSNotifcation,                   key-value observing, Core Data managed objects (observing                   `NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotification` and                   testing if an observed managed object's attributes or                   relationships have changed), and FSEvents (on Mac desktop                   only).                   The purpose of this is to model observer registration as an                   object, each with an associated block. This removes the need                   for the owning objects to dispatch to the desired code (if                   the observation always funnels through a single callback,                   such as key-value observing), and removes the need to                   manually unregister for notifications. With that, the                   possibility of *forgetting* to unregister for a notification                   (and the subsequent crash or bad behavior) is removed.

Use feature flags to hide code which is still in development.                                      DNTFeatures provides classes to register flags, query the state of a                    flag, and present a view controller to switch the flags on or off.                                      Extend this mechanism by allowing server control of flags, update the                   default value from a server to enable features in production. This can                   be used for powerful release strategies, such as turning on a feature                   gradually over a user base, or restrict features to user/market slices.                                      Additionally, you can define debug options for feature to further                    control behaviour or allow additional configuration during development                   or QA. E.g. Enable Verbose Logging for a particular feature.

This layer keeps its shape by syncing with the underlying CALayer.bounds animation.Great for when you want to animate movement, sizechange with NSLayoutConstraints. !!NOTE This will cause funky layout's if you animate CALayer.bounds directly.

2857	DownPicker		82		24		https://github.com/Darkseal/DownPicker.git		Lightweight class library for creating drop down list controls for iOS.		DownPicker is an extremely light-weight class library for creating DropDownList / ComboBox controls for iOS that will behave like their HTML / Android counterparts.You'll only need a standard UITextField and few lines of code.DownPicker is basically a *control interface wrapper*, meaning that you won't use it as a control - it will use an existing UITextField control instead.This is a good thing, because you'll be able to design, positioning and skin your UITextField like you always do, programmatically or inside a *Storyboard* UI, depending on how you are used to work. You won't change your style, as it will adapt to suit yours.However, if you don't like the *control wrapper* pattern, you can just use it as a *custom control* using the included **UIDownPicker** class. It's entirely up to you (and very easy to install in both scenarios).DownPicker is released under MIT License.Installation instructions, examples and documentation are available in the included README.md file.

However, thanks to the new APIs brought by WKWebView, you can now have much more accurate loading progress callbacks.See `DWUWebViewProgressDelegate` in [DWUWebView.h][h_file] for more details. It's a delegation style API and is really easy to use.#Known IssuesDue to WKWebView's implementation details, you can find a list of unsupported APIs in [DWUWebView.h][h_file].Besides, due to an architectural change that forces WKWebView to process JavaScript injection on an asynchronous basis. The `stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:` API will always return a garbage value.

Accessing and manipulating HTML and XML in Cocoa can be incredibly frustrating. There are two existing choices (NSXMLParser and lib2xml) but neither work with HTML or "real-world" XML documents that are often not "perfect".

It'll work well on shared code between iOS and Mac projects without you needing to alter code to accomodate either individually.'            ## Usage            Get the colors from a `UIColor`or `NSColor` from any of your favourite color pickers. And from there you:            ```objc            // iOS            #import NSColor+EMIHexiColor.h            someViewYouWantToColor.backgroundColor = [AnyOSColor colorWithHexRGB:@"FF9500"];            ```            ```objc            // OS X            #import NSColor+EMIHexiColor.h            someViewYouWantToColor.backgroundColor = [AnyOSColor colorWithHexRGB:@"FF0000"];            ##How It Works            `AnyOSColor` is actually a macro that is handled at compile time. depending on what you're compiling for i.e. iOS or OSX, AnyOSColor ultimately renders to UIColor ot NSColor.            ##Caveats            Because this category was needed in a hurry, alot of the input string checking was skipped (i.e. the hex string checking). Feel free to update it and let me know so i can add it to the repo for others to enjoy too.            ##Caveats            There are two demo's apps with the code, both for OS X and iOS.            ### Version            1.0.5            ### Mentions            This grand bottle of wine that kept me sane this evening!

Specifically it implements a single initial ping and tracking event to your Facebook App using the Facebook Graph API. This flows the (iOS6+) advertiser identifier and the ``fb_app_attribution`` data which the Facebook iOS app places on the system pasteboard if an install occured from the Facebook iOS app. The tracking data about use and installs will show up with a 2-day lag as daily-/weekly-/monthly-active user information and daily installs in your applications Insights, and it will show up as installs in near real-time during active Mobile App Ads campaigns. (Update: the new Insights dashboard no longer has 2-day lag, find it at https://www.facebook.com/insights/<Your-Facebook-App-ID>)The code consolidates and compacts the logic found in [FBUtility.m](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk/blob/master/src/FBUtility.m#L358-L403) which is called from [FBSettings.m](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk/blob/master/src/FBSettings.m#L371-L387) and uses a standard ``NSURLConnection`` instead of the heavier (but more useful in general cases) ``FBRequest`` object of the full SDK.If you are only interested in running Facebook Mobile App Install Ad Campaigns, this is all the Facebook SDK logic you need.

I'm not a huge fan of constantly having to type```objcif (theIndexIWantToAccess < theArrayImUsing.count) {    //Now I'm safe} else {    //I would have crashed here}```Call me lazy, be a hater, just know that these categories aren't meant to replace writing correct code. These categories are predicated on the fact that *we make mistakes* and these mistakes should be learned from while not crashing production apps.*This means that some remote logging should probably be set up so that we can actually learn from the times these categories prevent a crash.*These categories currently contain safety methods for:- NSArray / NSMutableArray- NSDictionary / NSMutableDictionary- NSObject (just to support the items above)Installation--------------If I've done my job and submitted this to Cocoapods, you should just be able to install with:```shpod install FoundationSafety```otherwise there's always submodules :)License----MIT**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**

The GLView library is modular. If you don't want to render 3D models you can omit the Models classes and the rest of the library will still work. If you aren't interested in loading and displaying images and just want a basic OpenGL context set up for you, you can omit the Images and Models classes.

Objective-C's switch statements only work on primitive types that are constant at compile time.                   However, many Objective-C APIs expect the developer to determine their behaviour based on identifiers passed in as NSString.                   To deal with this, HCObjectSwitch adds a simple syntax that is very similar to the native switch statement.                   In order to avoid clashing with the native syntax, all keywords start with a capital letter.

4345	HeliumKit		4		0		https://github.com/tanis2000/HeliumKit.git		HeliumKit is a lightweight framework that sits between your web services and the business logic of your app.		                        It provides basic mapping to automate conversion from DTO coming from your web services into object models of your business domain. We decided to streamline the process by adopting some libraries and frameworks:                        - PromiseKit to manage all the async code                        - FMDB to store data in SQLite                        - Mantle to convert models to and from JSON representation                        - MTLFMDBAdapter to convert models into SQL statements to feed to FMDB                        The main focus is to keep this framework as lightweight as possible and at the same time make it flexible enough for you to craft the perfect solution to your data transfer and storage layer. Many ideas come from RestKit as I've been using that framework for commercial apps before. But I've never been fond of Core Data as the storage architecture. I'm way too used to good old SQL statements and I can't live with the threading issues that you have to fight against when using Core Data. Core Data is great, but it's not for me.                        HeliumKit can simply keep your data in in-memory models or it can write them to SQLite as needed. That's completely configurable. I tried to keep in mind the convention over configuration paradigm as I hate boilerplate code.

4470	HRSAdvancedTableViews		4		1		https://github.com/Hotel-Reservation-Service/HRSAdvancedTableViews.git		HRSAdvancedTableViews is a collection of useful table view additions, split into several subspecs.		The Advanced Table Views library is a set of modules that make handling table views more convenient. The different modules are split into cocoapods subspecs so that you can only include the modules you are interested in. Some of the modules (like `HRSIndexPathMapping`) have advantages that might also be useful for other tasks than just table views, however they are mainly designed for the work with table views.# HRSSectionControllerThe section controller module deals with the problem of overloaded table view controllers. It separates the data model of a table view by its sections. Each section has its own controller that is responsible for providing the table view with the information it needs by implementing the necessary methods from `UITableViewDelegate` and `UITableViewDataSource`.# HRSIndexPathMappingThe index path mapping module is used for mapping index paths of every kind through a visibility / active state. This is mostly used to map index paths in the `UITableView` or `UICollectionView` context but can be used by every other logic that deals with index paths and needs to map between two sets of index paths based on various conditions.In practice, this is used to collapse or hide a couple of rows or sections inside a table view based on your current model data.
4471	HRSCustomErrorHandling		14		2		https://github.com/Hotel-Reservation-Service/HRSCustomErrorHandling.git		HRSCustomErrorHandling provides an easy way to handle error presentation and creation on iOS.		                       HRSCustomErrorHandling is a small Framework that provides a base implementation for error handling in iOS applications. It deals with the problem to streamline the presentation of errors in various parts of an application as well as provide APIs to implement error specific recovery options the user of the application can choose from.						The presentation of an error is reduced to a single line of code that can be called from any view, view controller or any other class that inherits from `UIResponder`:						    [self presentError:error completionHandler:^(BOOL didRecover) {						        if (didRecover) {						             [self tryAgain];						        }						    }];						This is all the code you need to implement in your view controllers if an operation that returns an `NSError` fails.

Check out the demo app. You almost certainly want to subclass the                   cell class (example in the demo app) and probably the header view                   class (not done in the demo app).                                      Thanks to UICollectionView it supports any size and also allows resizing.                   If you set non white/clear cell backgrounds or borders however, you will                   want to be careful with your sizes to avoid inconsistent gaps between days.                   Also, if you change the width during rotation, animation is a bit laggy                   especially on iOS 6.                                      A major caveat at the moment is that the headers are very sparsely documented.

4500	HTKUltimateParentalGate		14		3		https://github.com/henrytkirk/HTKUltimateParentalGate.git		The Ultimate Parental Gate to help block children from accessing in app purchase. Combines both math and dexterity skills.		                   The Ultimate Parental Gate is designed to help block children from accessing in app purchases within an app. Most "Parental Gates" simply ask a math question or provide a question that a child can figure out by randomly selecting an item on the screen. This is unique in it requires both math and dexterity skills to succeed, which typically a child does not have at a young age. This is the same Parental Gate used in the popular special needs app, SpeechBox for iPad. Therefore, this has been tested for over a year in both home and clinical environments, and have yet had a child get past the gate. This doesn't mean it's perfect, but it provides more security than other solutions.

You have the choice between doing your layout in interface builder which is great for static, but not powerful enough for dynamic content, or doing all in code which is difficult to maintain.In Android layouts can be defined in XML. Views automatically adjust their size while taking into account their content requirements and their parents' size restrictions.

If a targetView's frame will be intersected by the keyboard, then the avoidingView will move up just above the keyboard.What sets IHKeyboardAvoiding apart from other keyboard avoiding solutions is that it doesn't require placing your content in a UIScrollView. No scroll view is used. And it isn't restricted to keeping UITextFields visible, instead any UIView can be a target which will be kept visibleIf Autolayout is used then the constraints are animated, otherwise a CGAffine translation is done

It can collect the results of multiple operations, either objects or errors. When all operations finish, you get a completion handler with the results in a structured order, regardless of which order they complete. You can run these operations either on the main queue, on a single background thread pool, or on a multi-threaded background pool. It makes it easier to organize code and obtain results, letting you build powerful higher-order operations that rely on multiple asynchronous calls. IIIAsync is heavily modeled after and inspired by the brilliant async.js library by Caolan McMahon.

Normally the standard UISplitViewController doesn't hear about rotations when it's not the frontmost UI element (selected tab). This is because Apple believes a UISplitViewController should be the top-most controller in the hierarchy. So when you rotate the device while switching back and forth between tabs of split views, your view controllers and UI elements start drawing in mismatched orientations.  Users don't like this nonsense.  But what do you do if your app *needs* split views within a tab view?  This.  This is what you do.

4873	INTUAnimationEngine		807		50		https://github.com/intuit/AnimationEngine.git		Easily build advanced custom animations on iOS.		INTUAnimationEngine makes it easy to build advanced custom animations on iOS.INTUAnimationEngine provides a friendly interface to drive custom animations using a CADisplayLink, inspired by the UIView block-based animation API. It enables interactive animations (normally driven by user input, such as a pan or pinch gesture) to run automatically over a given duration. It can also be used to get a callback every frame of an animation.INTUAnimationEngine includes an extensive library of easing functions that can be used to customize animation timing, as well as a complete library of interpolation functions to animate any type of value or property including those that are not animatable by Core Animation. The project also includes a standalone spring physics library to simulate damped harmonic motion. This is used under the hood to power a spring animation API on INTUAnimationEngine that allows full control over the damping, stiffness, and mass parameters. Since the spring solver is a completely independent and generic library implemented in pure C, it can be used on its own for many other applications apart from animation.
4874	INTUGroupedArray		198		16		https://github.com/intuit/GroupedArray.git		An Objective-C and Swift collection for iOS and OS X that stores objects grouped into sections.		INTUGroupedArray is an Objective-C data structure that takes the common one-dimensional array to the next dimension. The grouped array is designed with a familiar API to fit right in alongside Foundation collections like NSArray, with fully-featured immutable and mutable variants. A thin bridge brings the grouped array to Swift as native classes, where it harnesses the power, safety, and flexibility of generics, optionals, subscripts, literals, tuples, and much more.INTUGroupedArray is extremely versatile, and can replace complicated nested arrays or combinations of other data structures as a general purpose data storage mechanism. The grouped array is ideal to use as a UITableView data source, as it is highly compatible with the data source and delegate callbacks -- requiring only a single line of code in many cases. However, it is suitable for use across the entire stack of iOS and OS X applications.
4875	INTULocationManager		1272		152		https://github.com/intuit/LocationManager.git		Easily get the device's current location on iOS.		# INTULocationManagerINTULocationManager makes it easy to get the device's current location on iOS.INTULocationManager provides a block-based asynchronous API to request the current location, either once or continuously. It internally manages multiple simultaneous location requests, and each one-time request can specify its own desired accuracy level and timeout duration. INTULocationManager automatically starts location services when the first request comes in, and stops location services as soon as all requests have been completed to conserve power.## What's wrong with CLLocationManager?CLLocationManager requires you to manually detect and handle things like permissions, stale/inaccurate locations, errors, and more. CLLocationManager uses a more traditional delegate pattern instead of the modern block-based callback pattern. And while it works fine to track changes in the user's location over time (such as for turn-by-turn navigation), it is extremely cumbersome to correctly request a single location update (such as to determine the user's current city to get a weather forecast, or to autofill an address from the current location).INTULocationManager makes it easy to request the device's current location, either once or continuously. The API is extremely simple for both one-time requests and subscriptions. For one-time location requests, you can specify how accurate of a location you need, and how long you're willing to wait to get it. INTULocationManager is power efficient and conserves the user's battery by powering down location services (e.g. GPS) as soon as they are no longer needed.

Of course, as you might expect of a formal standard, its more sophisticated (some might say complicated) than that: it also provides week date and ordinal date formats.This formatter can both parse and unparse dates in all three ISO 8601 formats.

5329	JPCDataSourceController		1		0		https://github.com/jpchmura/JPCDataSourceController.git		A structured, OO approach to Table and Collection views. Fetching and showing content from an API made simple.		Table and Collection views populated with content fetched from a web API is essential a large number of apps. Yet I've seen many poor implementations of this design.  I think Apple's API for table and collection views tends to lead developers into creating view controllers with a couple thousand lines of code, most of which isn't really "view controller" responsibilities (I know I've done it).  This violates the SOLID design principle of single responsibility and makes the code not very reusable.  I think it may be best that the data source is never part of the view controller.  Leaving the view controller free to handle more appropriate tasks.  Here are some of the higlights:* DataSourceController class handles the logic to drive table and collection view data sources* Data source is divided into Fetch Requests, backing Models, and Cell Factories* A state machine in DataSourceController neatly drives Fetching, Preparing Content, and Reloading data* Set a list of Models to combine multiple data sources* BackgroundView class displays an activity view while loading data and can display helpful error messages when loading fails* Animators make it easy to animate changes in content* Supports embedded collection views (Like in App Store)* Very minimal code required to get up and running* Pull to refresh (Coming soon)* Infinite scrolling (Coming soon)

Override moveEverythingAccordingToIndex(index: CGFloat).Now, you can see your views, but they are static.Step ThreeImplement the moveEverythingAccordingToIndex(index: CGFloat) in each view. The index: CGFloat variable is the offset of the scroller. In the first and the last view, index: CGFloat range from 0 ~ frame.width. In all the other views, index: CGFloat range from 0 ~ 2 * frame.width.We have build-in functions, but you can easily customize your animation with CGAffineTransformation. There are more example in the demo project.Also implement the moveEverythingAccordingToIndex(index: CGFloat) in viewcontroller to perform color animation and touchable elements. All the touchable elements must be added in the view controller and call view.bringSubviewToFront() after setup to make them reachable.You can literally create any kind of animation!

Having authenticated with a web service using OAuth2 and received the tokens I wanted to be able store them  sercurely. Whilst investigating secure storage on iOS I came across the ability to store small amounts of  data in the iOS Keychain. As the set of OAuth tokens is a couple of strings and number representing the  time to live of the token then this seemed like the ideal mechanism.    However, the Keychain API isn't that simple nor succint to use and can only store a single piece of data.   This single piece of data can be an instance of NSData this means arbitrary objects can be stored.  I created a small library that allowd the Creation, Reading, Updating and Deletion (CRUD) of instances of  NSData. Futher rather than having to create instances of NSData I provided a layer on top that manipulates  any object that supports NSCoding.

6036	LGBluetooth		43		21		https://github.com/l0gg3r/LGBluetooth.git		Simple, block-based, lightweight library over CoreBluetooth.		                     As we know CoreBluetooth is very hard to use - The methods of objects in Core bluetooth are messyFor example connectPeripheral:options: is written in CBCentralManager, discoverCharacteristics:forService is written in Peripheral, writeValue:forCharacteristic:type, readValueForCharacteristic are also in PeripheralThis messy code makes CoreBluetooth development really painfull. For example if you need to read characteristic value, you need to call "connect" on central object, wait for Central delegate callback, After that call "discover services", wait peripheral delegate callback, "discover characteristic" which you planned and wait for delegate callback, "readValue" and again wait for delegate callback. What will happen if your program will make 2 connections at once? Handling such cases makes messy code, and raises hundred of bugs.Don't worry, now you can forgot about that hell - LGBluetooth uses blocks for callbacks, you can start using modern code and hierarchical calls.

6094	libidn		0		0		https://github.com/chrisballinger/libidn.git		Encode/decode i18n domains using Stringprep, Punycode and IDNA.		GNU Libidn is a fully documented implementation of the Stringprep, Punycode and IDNA specifications. Libidn's purpose is to encode and decode internationalized domain names. The native C, C# and Java libraries are available under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or later.The library contains a generic Stringprep implementation. Profiles for Nameprep, iSCSI, SASL, XMPP and Kerberos V5 are included. Punycode and ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) via IDNA are supported. A mechanism to define Top-Level Domain (TLD) specific validation tables, and to compare strings against those tables, is included. Default tables for some TLDs are also included.The Stringprep API consists of two main functions, one for converting data from the system's native representation into UTF-8, and one function to perform the Stringprep processing. Adding a new Stringprep profile for your application within the API is straightforward. The Punycode API consists of one encoding function and one decoding function. The IDNA API consists of the ToASCII and ToUnicode functions, as well as an high-level interface for converting entire domain names to and from the ACE encoded form. The TLD API consists of one set of functions to extract the TLD name from a domain string, one set of functions to locate the proper TLD table to use based on the TLD name, and core functions to validate a string against a TLD table, and some utility wrappers to perform all the steps in one call.The library is used by, e.g., GNU SASL and Shishi to process user names and passwords. Libidn can be built into GNU Libc to enable a new system-wide getaddrinfo flag for IDN processing.Libidn is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20 Unix platforms (including Solaris, IRIX, AIX, and Tru64) and Windows. The library is written in C and (parts of) the API is also accessible from C++, Emacs Lisp, Python and Java. A native Java and C# port is included.Also included is a command line tool, several self tests, code examples, and more, all licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.0 or later.

Not the Lock Screen one, but the one you get in Settings when changing your passcode.I made it a singleton because if the lock is active, when leaving the app a view must be placed on top, so no data from within the app can be seen in the multitasking mode. This is done under the hood, without having to do anything extra.# How to useDrag the contents of `LTHPasscodeViewController` to your project, or add `pod 'LTHPasscodeViewController'` to your podspec file.* When opened from Settings (as a modal):```objc- (void)showForEnablingPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController;- (void)showForChangingPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController;- (void)showForTurningOffPasscodeInViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController;// Example:[[LTHPasscodeViewController sharedUser] showForEnablingPasscodeInViewController: self]```* At app launch, or whenever you'd like the user to be shown a passcode entry:```objc- (void)showLockscreenWithAnimation:(BOOL)animated;// Example:[[LTHPasscodeViewController sharedUser] showLockscreenWithAnimation: YES]// Displayed with a slide up animation, which, combined with// the keyboard sliding down animation, creates an "unlocking" impression.```* entering foreground and resigning is handled from within the class.Everything is easily customizable with macros and static constants.Makes use of [SFHFKeyChainUtils](https://github.com/ldandersen/scifihifi-iphone) to save the passcode in the Keychain. I know he dropped support for it, but I updated it for ARC 2 years ago ([with help](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7663443/sfhfkeychainutils-ios-keychain-arc-compatible)) and I kept using it since. The 'new' version isn't updated to ARC anyway, so I saw no reason to switch to it, or to any other library.Rather than writing a big documentation, I heavily commented it as best as I could. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:roland@rolandleth.com), or open an issue if anything is unclear, bugged, or can be improved.## Removing Unused LocalizationsBecause the App Store automatically attempts to determine supported locales, and LTHPasscodeViewController includes localizations for the aforementioned locales, you may want to remove the `.strings` file and `.lproj` directory. You can do this most easily by having the following command run in a new Build Phase:        $ find "$TARGET_BUILD_DIR" -maxdepth 8 -type f -name "LTHPasscodeViewController.strings" -execdir rm -r -v {} ;# Apps using this control[Expenses Planner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expenses-planner-reminders/id669431471?mt=8)[DigitalOcean Manager](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/digitalocean-manager/id633128302?mt=8)[LovelyHeroku](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lovelyheroku/id706287663?mt=8&uo=4)[Flow Web Browser](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flow-web-browser-downloader/id705536564?mt=8)[Balance - Checkbook App](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id854362248)If you're using this control, I'd love hearing from you!

6407	M13InfiniteTabBar		596		76		https://github.com/Marxon13/M13InfiniteTabBar.git		An elegant redesign of UITabBar for iOS Applications.		                   M13InfiniteTabBar is an elegant replacement for UITabBar. UITabBar becomes a problem when you have more than five view controllers that have the need to be accessed an equal amount of times. It maskes no sense to hide any of the tabs away under the "More" tab. Plus it takes two extra clicks to reach the view controllers behind the "More" button. M13InfiniteTabBar solves this problem by having all the view controllers on a single level. The "extra" view controllers can be reached by scrolling the tab bar left or right. The scrolling does pose a problem though, in which direction is my offscreen tab? M13InfiniteTabBar solves this by putting the tabs in an infinite scrolling loop. Any tab can be reached by scrolling in any direction. M13InfiniteTabBar also has a few other features that UITabBar doesn't offer on top of that.

6566	MBTraitCollection		7		0		https://github.com/MatejBalantic/MBTraitCollection.git		UIViewController category provides iOS7 compatible access to UITraitCollection object by exposing new property mbTraitCollection.							Trait collections are new as of iOS 8 and even if they compile with the latest SDK even for deployment targets older than 8.0, their use will cause crash in iOS 7 application. This renders them unusefull until application deployment target is restricted to 8.0.                    To solve that problem, I've created a category on UIViewController which exposes a new property mbTraitCollection. When accessing this property a backwards-compatible MBTraitCollection class will be lazy-loaded for you. Class is basically a wrapper around UITraitCollection and will use native behavior when possible (i.e. in iOS >= 8). On older iOS version, this class will use other available techniques to determine device characteristics for you, thus allowing you to use trait collection even on iOS 7.

MDCDamerauLevenshtein includes two algorithms for calculating                   the edit distance between NSString objects:                   1. Levenshtein distance calculates the number of insertions,                      deletions, and substitions necessary in order to convert one                      string into the other.                   2. Damerau-Levenshtein improves upon Levenshtein to include the                      transposition of two adjacent characters. Damerau states that                      some combination of the four operations make up for 80% of all                      human spelling errors.                   Potential applications for this library:                   - Don't just use `-[NSString compare:options:]` to filter search results,                     display terms with small edit distances.                   - ...and many more!

For example, if you need to find the tenth smallest number in an array of 100,000:                   ```objc                   #import <MDCQuickSelect/MDCQuickSelect.h>                   // 79% faster than sorting the numbers and accessing -objectAtIndex:10                   NSNumber *tenth = [numbers mdc_objectAtIndex:10                                       inSortedArrayUsingComparator:^NSComparisonResult(NSNumber *left, NSNumber *right) {                                           return [left compare: right];                                       }];                   ```                   Or to find the ten smallest numbers in an array of 100,000:                   ```objc                   // 71% faster than sorting the numbers and accessing -subarrayWithRange:NSMakeRange(0, 10)                   [numbers mdc_subarrayWithRange:NSMakeRange(0, 10)                    inSortedArrayUsingComparator:^NSComparisonResult(NSNumber *left, NSNumber *right){                                                     return [left.numberOfFriends compare:right.numberOfFriends];                                                 }];                   ```                   The improved performance is achieved by using the quickselect algorithm, developed by                   Tony Hoare, inventor of quicksort.                   Performance is infinitesimally worse when array size is less than 150 elements. For arrays                   larger than 150 elements, MDCQuickSelect outperforms the naive approach, sometimes by vast margins.                   Run the benchmarking tests and see for yourself!

It depends on the following Apple frameworks:		  * Foundation.framework		  * UIKit.framework		  ##Including MHRadialProgressView to your project		  ### Source files		  You can directly add the `MHRadialProgressView.h` and `MHRadialProgressView.m` source files to your project.		  1. Download the latest zip from github or clone the source in your desired directory.		  2. Open your project in Xcode, then drag and drop `MHRadialProgressView.h` and `MHRadialProgressView.m` onto your project (use the "Product Navigator view"). Make sure to select Copy items when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project. 		  3. Include MHRadialProgressView with `#import "MHRadialProgressView.h"`.		  ### Cocoapods		  [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add MHRadialProgressView to your project.		  1.

Add it as subview:		  		[self.view addSubview:self.progressView];		  3. Make progress by calling the following method:		  		[self.progressView moveNext];		  By default, the progress view displays % value. However you can override the style by calling the following method:		  	// Default is MHProgressStylePercentage. Sets the progress style		  	- (void)setProgressStyle:(MHProgressStyle)style;		  It is also possible to format the label that displays the progress value using the folloiwng method:		  	- (void)setLabelWithFormat:(NSString*)format;		  For unordered progres (often by steps associated wtih user action), you can increase the progress by value:		  	- (void) moveNext:(NSNumber*)value;		  ## License		  This code is distributed under the terms and conditions of the [MIT license](LICENSE).

The trigger can either contain the data beforehand, and will do everything for you, or you can provide the data dynamically using the data source.                   + **Custom Cells**: You can easily assign custom cells for the component, and use a "user info" dictionary that will be passed to your cell to initialize it.                   + **Centralized**: You can easily centralize the manager and the data source, so you can simply instantiate the `MJAutoCompleteManager` anywhere to present the view, but then use that centralized data source to feed in the data.                   ... And much, much more, so please check out the fully documented github demo to learn more.                   
6810	MJDijkstra		0		5		https://github.com/SSU-CS-Department/MJDijkstra.git		An implementation of Dijkstra algorithm in Objective C		Dijkstra algorithm finds all shortest paths from a vertex to each other vertex in a graph.The input graph G is assumed to have the following representation: A vertex can be any object that can be used as an index into a dictionary. G is a dictionary, indexed by vertices. For any vertex v, G[v] is itself a dictionary, indexed by the neighbors of v. For any edge v->w, G[v][w] is the length of the edge.This code is a port of a Python implementation of Dijkstra algorithm suggested by David Eppstein.See http://code.activestate.com/recipes/119466-dijkstras-algorithm-for-shortest-paths/?in=user-218935It also provides an implementation of a priority dictionary: a key value map which is also ordered by values.The implementation relies on C++ stl. stl::map and stl::make_heap do most of heavy lifting. New feature of clang is used to keep C++ out of Objective-C headers: ivars in class extensions.The project incliudes unit tests.

6861	MLImageCache		3		3		https://github.com/mll/MLImageCache.git		Simple yet powerful and fast image cache.		                 # MLImageCache                 ## Simple yet powerful asynchronous image cache                                  MLImageCache has been written as an alternative to clumsy [SDWebCache](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage). It is based on NSOperation / NSOperationQueue combo, which gives it additional features and safety.                                   The highlights:                                  * Two .m files and .h files. Just drag to your project and go. You can also use CocoaPods.                 * Asynchronous download and disk read gives it an unmatched speed. It does not interfere with scrolling.                 * Uses ARC and is carefully engineered not to induce strong reference cycles. It's memory reliability is thoroughly tested.                 * It downloads only one copy of an image no matter how many times has it been requested.                 * It can download arbitrary data, not only images.                 * It supports prioritization and simultaneous downloads based on NSOperationQueue priority system.                                  ## Installation                                    Use CocoaPods or copy those 4 files directly into the project. In the latter case you also have to install [ASIHTTPRequest](http://allseeing-i.com/ASIHTTPRequest/).                                     If you wonder why do I use this seemingly obsolete library compare its stability and functionality to [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking). It does not change interface every few months and is super-stable and tested.                                     ## How to use it?                                        #import "UIImageView+Cache.h"                     ...                     [self.imageView setImageWithURL: self.urlToImage ];                 And that's it! You can replace SDImageCache instantly. For more advanced features see MLImageCache.h

Special thanks to the following projects and articles that helped me create this:                        * [Google Material Design's Animated Loading Spinner Using HTML, CSS and SVG](http://david.ingledow.co.uk/blog/google-material-designs-animated-loading-spinner-svg-and-css/) for help figuring out exactly what animations were going on.                        * [LLARingSpinnerView](https://github.com/lipka/LLARingSpinnerView) as the base for a custom activity spinner UIView.                        * [center-vfl](https://github.com/evgenyneu/center-vfl) because centering things with Auto Layout's VFL is way harder than it should be to remember.                        * [kylefox / color.m gist](https://gist.github.com/kylefox/1689973) for creating random UIColor values.

Well, unlike the others out there, `MMMSwitch`:* Works great in Auto Layout environments  * It won't get distorted when it gets resized due to changing constraints or when it gets its size animated* Has a *rich state callback method*   * It can distinguish between all user-distinguishable states, so it can tell you whether it's completely off, or if, for instance, the user's pressing it down but has yet switched its state yet.   * Too much info for you? No problem -- just use the callback but check `MMMSwitch`'s `isOn` parameter inside of the callback and get the basic on/off info you want.

Typically 7 to 8 times faster than using UIView.		                      MotionJpegImageView creates a connection to the stream                      and receives JPEG frames one at a time over the network.                      It turns out this approach is typically seven or eight                      times faster than using UIWebView to render MJPEG                      streams.                      Just provide a URL for the video stream and you're good.                      Internally, MotionJpegImageView achieves better                      performance by avoiding overheads of parsing and                      rendering each frame as if it were a web page which                      UIView does.                      Internally, MotionJpegImageView creates a connection to                      the stream and receives frames one at a time over the                      network. As it receives each frame, it hydrates the                      stream data into a UIImage object, and then sets its                      inherited image property. Thus the only bottlenecks                      to getting high framerates are:                      1. The speed of your network connection                      2. The frame rate of the IP camera                      3. The phones ability to process inbound packets and                      rehydrate UIImage files from raw JPEG data.

As the standard +[UIView animateWithDuration:animations:] is not able to animate non-animatable properties, and text, font and textColor properties of UILabel, UITextView and UITextField, are non-animatable, you need to use CATransition to do so with animation. NRTextTransitions uses a similar API to the standard UIView class methods, encapsulating the changes passed in the animations parameter block.

Rather than having a corner case where you need to pass in NSErrors, you can simply throw the NSError                           if (!success) {                               [error throw];                           }                       Your code will either crash or be handled by your @try/@catch/@finally block.                       The logic used is along the lines of:                           @throw [NSException exceptionWithName:@"NSError" reason:self.debugDescription userInfo:@{ @"NSError" : self }];                       You can provide a more informative exception name by sending the - (void)throwWithName:(NSString*)name message instead.

Mac OS and iOS library for MongoDB and BSON.                    - Simple BSON encoding and decoding, using dictionaries.                    - Built-in support for arrays, dictionaries, embedded objects, strings, numbers, dates, object IDs, and the miscellaneous MongoDB types.                    - More complex encoding and decoding based on NSCoder's keyed coding scheme. A robust delegate interface lets you implement encoding and decoding entirely outside the model classes if necessary.                    - Automatically encodes and decodes Core Data entities. Using the coder's delegate interface you can customize the default behavior, or simply implement alternate behavior it in the entity class.                    - Aims to feel Cocoa-like, not Mongo-like. For example, method names in MongoKeyedPredicate and MongoUpdateRequest are natural in Cocoa, though they don't conform to the underlying Mongo keywords.

Once added, you instantiate subclasses of the WebFetcher class, configure them, then schedule then to run. Fetchers message one sific method in your control class, returning either the requested data (or response for a POST), or a failure indication. Reasons to use this project:- Empower any class you want to perform asynchronous HTTP activity easily and quickly.- Lightweight - only a few hundred lines of code. Enable the log messages to see EXACTLY what is happening.- With one message, you can essentially tear down all current sessions and activity (e.g., user hit the Back button).- Use a hierarchy of WebFetcher subclasses to add increasing complexity. The fetchers can perform processing functions, e.g. resize images, in the same background queue used by the fetcher.- Do you really want to use some huge bloated framework, where you have no control or even understanding.- Look at URfetcher7 and URSessionDelegate for an example of how to specialize (subclass) WebFetcher and ORSessionDelegate restively.

Any incorrect taps or swipes will dismiss the gate and optionally let your code know the user failed to prove themselves an adult.The class works on all iPhones, iPods, and iPads as far back as iOS 4.3 if you are so inclined. It handles all portrait, landscape, and upside-down orientations as well as orientation changes on the fly.The UI presentation is a fairly universal _Do Not Enter_ symbol, and the application comes with localizations to English, Spanish, French, and Chinese.

To installit, simply add the following line to your Podfile:```rubypod 'PARTagPicker'```## UsageTo run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the PRTagPicker directory first.The basic setup is to create an instance of `PARTagPickerViewController`, add it's view, and then add the controller as a child view controller.The tags are passed in as `NSString` objects in an array. Anytime you change the `allTags` array, any existing `chosenTags` are updated using references to the new strings if they contain a match in the updated array. Otherwise they continue to point the old strings.## Options* You can customize colors using a PARTagColorReference object.* You can allow new tags with `allowsNewTags` boolean property on the controller.* You can set the `chosenTags` directly.* Delegate methods for when the chosenTags change and the tag picker changes size.* `- (void)tagPicker:(PARTagPickerViewController *)tagPicker visibilityChangedToState:(PARTagPickerVisibilityState)state `* `- (void)chosenTagsWereUpdatedInTagPicker:(PARTagPickerViewController *)tagPicker`## NotesThis is still a work in progress. If you have suggestions or run into issues, please create an issue on git or tweet me [@ThePaulRolfe](http://twitter.com/thepaulrolfe).## Updates* v1.0.0 - Added documentation and fixed bug with deselecting chosenTags. Added ability to use custom fonts in the tag cells.* v0.0.5 - Added expected functionality of chosenTags being removed when pressed.## AuthorPaul Rolfe, paul.a.rolfe@gmail.com, [@ThePaulRolfe](http://twitter.com/thepaulrolfe)## LicensePARTagPicker is available under the MIT license.

8263	PartyTime		59		11		https://github.com/plivesey/PLPartyTime.git		A light wrapper around MultiPeer connectivity framework which allows apps to quickly connect people without invitations.		                   This is a light wrapper around the MultiPeer connectivity framework which quickly connects devices without having to send or receive invites. Here's the quick setup: Each device calls:     PLPartyTime *partyTime = [[PLPartyTime alloc] initWithServiceType@"MyApp"];    partyTime.delegate = self;    [partyTime joinParty]; Each device will get a callback when anyone connects or disconnects. Note that any device which joins the party with this service type will automatically join without sending or receiving invitations.    - (void)partyTime:(PLPartyTime *)partyTime peer:(MCPeerID *)peer changedState:(MCSessionState)state currentPeers:(NSArray *)currentPeers;  Then, anytime you want to send data, you can call a method to send to all connected users (peers) or an array of select peers.    - (BOOL)sendData:(NSData *)data withMode:(MCSessionSendDataMode)mode error:(NSError **)error;    - (BOOL)sendData:(NSData *)data toPeers:(NSArray *)peerIDs withMode:(MCSessionSendDataMode)mode error:(NSError **)error; The clients receiving data get the callback:    - (void)partyTime:(PLPartyTime *)partyTime didReceiveData:(NSData *)data fromPeer:(MCPeerID *)peerID; And that's it. There are a few more features of this library, but I'll let you read through the documentation to find those specifically.

The parsers it generates are re-entrant, thread-safe, and do not leak memory: they are suitable for inclusion in other programs.Pegged reads the grammar specified in file and will create a class of the same name. A .h and a .m file will then be created in the output directory, which may be specified from the command line and defaults to the directory containing the PEG grammar. The parser class adheres to a simple interface:    @protocol ParserDataSource;    typedef NSObject<ParserDataSource> ParserDataSource;    @interface Parser : NSObject    {    }    @property (retain) ParserDataSource *dataSource;    - (BOOL) parse;    - (BOOL) parseString:(NSString *)string;    @end        @protocol ParserDataSource    - (NSString *) nextString;    @endThe data to be parsed may either be provided via a data source (which responds to a single selector, -nextString) or via the -parseString: selector.

8427	Pig		8		0		https://github.com/ribot/pig.git		Pig aims to be the bridge in the middle of your native mobile UI and a some shared JavaScript business logic.		                   Developing for multiple mobile platforms is both time-consuming and expensive. Writing completely separate                   versions in Java and Objective-C in parallel duplicates logic and wastes effort, especially when requirements                   change. Writing an application using PhoneGap generally leads to the UI to feeling non-standard and ultimately                   to a sub-par user experience.                   Pig aims to solves these problems by moving the business logic into a shared Javascript codebase. On each platform                   (currently Android and iOS), the user interface is implemented in native code, leading the best possible user                   experience, while data manipulation and other logic is handled by the shared Javascript.

In many cases, an animation may be as simple as: [PRTween tween:someView property:@"alpha" from:1 to:0 duration:3]; In order to promote simplicity, PRTween can be used as a drop-in replacement for most animations in your app. This means that in the case displayed above, the end result is identical to writing a UIView animation yourself.

For usage examples, see WWDC 2015 Advanced NSOperations and/or look at the included unit tests.Feel free to fork and submit pull requests, as we are always looking for improvements from the community.Differences from the first version of the WWDC sample code:- Canceling operations would not work.- Canceling functions are slightly more friendly.- Negated Condition would not negate.- Unit tests!Differences from the second version of the WWDC sample code:- Sometimes canceling wouldn't work correctly in iOS 8.4. The finished override wasn't being called during cancel. We have fixed this to work in both iOS 8.4 and iOS 9.0.- Canceling functions are slightly more friendly.- Unit tests!A difference from the WWDC Sample code worth mentioning:- When conditions are evaluated and they fail the associated operation is cancelled. The operation still goes through the same flow otherwise, only now it will be marked as cancelled.

But what about users who like an app?  How many apps have you reviewed?  It probably isn't that many even if you are happy with many of the apps that you are using.  So what happens to users who are perfectly happy with an app and continue to use it?  They probably never provide a review.In order for a user to actually post a review, they have to be very motivated to do so or it has to be EXTREMELY easy.  If they aren't motivated, they won't bother.  *Review Request* is designed to make it extremely easy to review an app.  Once your user has a chance to use your newest version they are asked to post a review.  How long before prompting is up to _you_ the developer.Remember this won't make your app any better.  It will just make it easier for people to review.  If your app is bad, expect more negative feedback.  If you app is good, hopefully you will see more positive feedback.###Adding the code to your projectEither add `ReviewRequest.xcproj` to your project or directly add `ReviewRequest.m` and `ReviewRequest.h`.All user visible text is exposed as properties so it can be customized for your application and fit in to your localization story.  All properties are documented in the header file.###Configuring your appTo ask for a rating, just add the following code to your startup path.  Don't worry about spamming the user.  You can configure the number of launches before requesting a review as well as the minimum amount of time between first launch and the request.  This will only prompt once per version.  (See the documentation in the header.)  The defaults require that the user launch your app at least 12 times and that at least 23 hours have passed since the first launch.    NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"insert your URL here"];    ReviewRequest *reviewRequest = [[ReviewRequest alloc] initWithItunesUrl:url];    [reviewRequest askForReviewIfNeeded];###Getting your app's App Store URLYou can get the URL for your app by following these steps:  - Open iTunes an select the iTunes store  - Enter your app's name in the search box.  Press enter.  - Control click on your app and select "Copy iTunes Store URL" from the context menu.That will look something like the following:`http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google+/id12345?mt=8`This will launch the App Store and open the page about your app.  However, you can even do better.  If you use the following format, the user will be taken directly ratings for your app.  However, make sure you change the 12345 for your app's ID.  You will find the ID in the URL that you copied from iTunes.`itms-apps://ax.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewContentsUserReviews?type=Purple+Software&id=12345`*You must test this on a device and not on the simulator, the App Store is not installed on the simulator.*#####Review Request is based on the work of Games From Within.

The JSONObjectExtractor utility class can provide a SAX style parser for the special case of JSON arrays containing dictionaries. Itaccepts a stream of NSData objects from a NSURLConnection or NSURLSession, which comprise a JSON array. Then, it passes NSJSONSerialization decoded objects back to the delegate as they are detected. In addition, if the JSON stream is from a MongoDB service, it intercepts and rewrites 'ObjectID(...)' and 'new Date(...)' fields, so the JSON can be parsed by NSJSONSerialization. The overhead cost for this rewriting is trivial, and several orders of magnitude faster than using regular expressions on the raw text to do it. For proper usage, see the demo project on github.

9892	SimpleCam		201		32		https://github.com/LoganWright/SimpleCam.git		A Memory Efficient Drop In Replacement / Alternative for the Native UIImagePicker Camera		SimpleCam was created out of the necessity to have high quality photographs while providing a lightweight memory footprint. Apple's UIImagePicker is a wonderful application, but because it has a lot of features and a lot of options, . . . it uses a lot of MEMORY. This can cause crashes, lag, and an overall poor experience when all you wanted was to give the user an opportunity to take a quick picture.If you're capturing photographs with UIImagePicker, or via AVFoundation on the highest possible capture resolution, it will return giant image files exceeding thousands of pixels in size. SimpleCam avoids this while still using the highest possible capture resolution by resizing the photo to 2x the size of the phone's screen. This allows the photo to maintain a significantly reduced file size while still looking clean and brilliant on mobile displays.I hope you find the project as useful as I did!

It is designed so you can bind two objects or UIViews, or any other combination of those two. Basic purpose of this component is to enable binding between models and Views without having to write a lot of unnecessary code which handels everything.	`SKBindingManager` allows you to dynamically add or remove bindings. You can specify wheather you would like one-way or two-way binding. It has an integrated support for cycle detection in your bindings. For instance if you have object `A` with properties `a`, `b` and `c`. You will not be allowed to make bindings like this `A.a -> A.b -> A.c -> A.a` because that would cause bindings to refresh themselves indefinetly. You can also define specific transformations you want to do before for instance `A.a` refreshes object `A.b` via blocks.	##Supported objects for binding	Bindings are supported for any kind of user defined `NSObject` subclasses and in `UIKit` for `UILabel`, `UITextField`, `UITextView`, `UISwitch` and `UISlider`. But you can add support for custom `UIView` objects.

Specifically, when its `zoomScale == minimumZoomScale`, it zooms-in the view to the tapped point and to the scale defined by by the `maximumZoomScale`. Otherwise, when `zoomScale > minimumZoomScale`, it zooms-out to a scale defined by the `minimumZoomScale`. The double-tap gesture is available through the `doubleTapGestureRecognizer` property to disable or adjust the gesture behaviour.                        ![double-tap-to-zoom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/97896/5738194/2929502a-9bf2-11e4-86a4-06367f28befd.png)                        - When SMScrollView's bounds are changed, for example due to a change in an interface orientation, then:                          1. If its `fitOnSizeChange == YES`, then its content is rescaled to fit its new size, up to the scale of 1.0, such that content is never stretched.                          ![fit-on-size-change](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/97896/5738193/2929067e-9bf2-11e4-895e-1f7c4798f64b.png)                          2. If `fitOnSizeChange == NO`, then the content point that was displayed in the center of its bounds before the size change, is kept in center after the size change. However, if `stickToBounds` property was set to `YES` and the scroll-view was scrolled to one of its boundaries before the size change, then it is kept at these boundaries instead of keeping the center point in center.                          ![maintain-center-point](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/97896/5738195/292994cc-9bf2-11e4-9e82-6509be403bdb.png)

SMWebRequest is a very handy lightweight HTTP request class for iOS.                    It encapsulates a single HTTP request and response, and is designed to be less verbose and simpler to use than NSURLConnection. The server response is buffered completely into memory then passed back to event listeners as NSData. Optionally, you can specify a delegate which can process the NSData in some way on a background thread then return something else.

10116	SOA-iOS-SDK		8		0		https://github.com/espeiorin/SOA-iOS-SDK.git		SOA-iOS-SDK is a client built to consume SOA Server based APIs.		                   [SOA Server](https://github.com/coderockr/soa) is a great way to build your Web Services, it's built on top of Silex and Doctrine 2, but using iOS as a client you couldn't get the same experience, until now. After a long time using SOA Server I decided to transport the same mindset to Objective-C and the result is this library.                    ##Getting SOA iOS SDK                    ###Cocoapods                    ##Configure it                    In order to get SOA SDK working, you must configure the API URL and shared headers.                    * apiURL for the REST Calls                    * rpcURL for the RPC Calls                    ```objc                    [SOAManager defaultManager].apiURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://serveraddress.com/api/v1"];                    [SOAManager defaultManager].rpcURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://serveraddress.com/rpc/v1"];                    [[SOAManager defaultManager] setDefaultHeaders:@{@"Authorization" : @"_authorization_token_"}];                    ```                    Including shared headers for each HTTP Method available at REST API.                    ```objc                    SOAServiceMethodGET,                    SOAServiceMethodPOST,                    SOAServiceMethodPUT,                    SOAServiceMethodDELETE,                    SOAServiceMethodALL                    [[SOAManager defaultManager] setDefaultHeaders:@{@"Content-Type" : @"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"} forMethod:SOAServiceMethodPOST];                    [[SOAManager defaultManager] setDefaultHeaders:@{@"Content-Type" : @"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"} forMethod:SOAServiceMethodPUT];                    ```                    ###Miscelaneous                    Right now, you can configure the queue concurrent requests limits and you can also delegate to SOA SDK the responsability to display or hide the Network Activity Status.                    ```objc                    [SOAManager defaultManager].maxConcurrentRequests = 4;                    [SOAManager defaultManager].controlNetworkActivity = YES;                    ```                    ##The SOA Object                    SOAObject is a NSObject subclass built to storage entity's data. SOAObject has only one mandatory property, which is Entity Name, but you can set the entity id. Both properties are intended to identify the object.                     Beyond it, you can store any kind of data (pointers) using setValue:forKey: and you can also retrieve any data using valueForKey: method.                    ###Creating New                    ```objc                    SOAObject *hotel = [[SOAObject alloc] initWithEntityName:@"hotel"];                    SOAObject *knownHotel = [[SOAObject alloc] initWithEntityName:@"hotel" entityId:12];                    ```                    ###Dealing with data                    ```objc                    [hotel setValue:@"Ibis" forKey:@"name"];                    [hotel setValue:@"R.

10243	SPStackedNav		87		7		https://github.com/spotify/SPStackedNav.git		UINavigationController drop-in replacement with stacks of panes, like Spotify or old Twitter.		    SPStackedNavigationController is a UINavigationController drop-in replacement,    which represents its content in stacks of panes, rather than one at a time.    This interface trend was started by Loren Brichter in Tweetie for iPad, and    has spread to many apps in many variations since.    There are two main advantages to this approach:    * You can display two pieces of main content at once, allowing you to      navigate in one while using content in the other.    * Navigation is direct instead of indirect, which is faster and more      intuitive to use. You actually grab the UI and *pull* it to where you want      it. In contrast, a standard navigation controller requires you to find and      tap a button with an abstract "back" concept.    The main drawback is that you should no longer use horizontal gestures, as    they will interfere with navigation, or the other way around.

Subjective-Script makes Objective-C more scripty!                      My language of preference is CoffeeScript and whenever I develop in Objective-C, I find myself often having to look up [NSSomething reallyLongFunctionName:YES withAVerboseParameterName:YES and:[NSSomethingElse whichAddsMoreBrackets]] and it isn't very enjoyable or speedy!                      While I was porting a test for [_.m](https://github.com/kmalakoff/_.m) from the original [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) that was easy to read:                      ```JavaScript                      var people = [{name : 'curly', age : 50}, {name : 'moe', age : 30}];                      people = _.sortBy(people, function(person){ return person.age; });                      equal(_.pluck(people, 'name').join(', '), 'moe, curly', 'stooges sorted by age');                      ```                      It looked like this in Objective-C:                      ```                      NSArray *people = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:                        [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: @"moe", @"name", [NSNumber numberWithInt:30], @"age", nil],                        [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: @"curly", @"name", [NSNumber numberWithInt:50], @"age", nil],                        nil];                      STAssertEqualObjects([_.pluck(people, @"name") componentsJoinedByString:@", "],                                           @"moe, curly",                                           @"stooges sorted by age");                      ```                      The keys were in the wrong order, there was too much typing involved, and it became unreadable. So I wrote [Subjective-Script](https://github.com/kmalakoff/SubjectiveScript.m) and ported [QUnit.m](https://github.com/kmalakoff/QUnit.m) to end up with this:                      ```                      A* people = AO(OKV({@"name", @"curly"}, {@"age", N.I(50)}), OKV({@"name", @"moe"}, {@"age", N.I(30)}));                      people = _.sortBy(people, ^(O* person){ return person.get(@"age"); });                      equal(_.pluck(people, @"name").join(@", "), @"moe, curly", @"stooges sorted by age");                      ```                      Much better! And best of all, I can reuse my knowledge of JavaScript for function names so I can stop looking things up and get stuff done!

11301	TLLayoutTransitioning		258		27		https://github.com/wtmoose/TLLayoutTransitioning.git		Enhanced transitioning between UICollectionView layouts in iOS.		                    TLLayoutTransitioning provides a `TLLayoutTransition` transition layout subclass and a `UICollectionView+TLTransitioning` category that combine to solve a few problems with collection view layout transitioning:                    1. `UICollectionViewLayoutTransition` does not handle content offset well, often leaving cells where you don't want them. `TLTransitionLayout` provides elegant control of content offset with Minimal, Visible, Center, Top, Left, Bottom or Right placement options relative to one or more index paths.                    2. `UICollectionViewLayoutTransition` does not support supplementary views. `TLTransitionLayout` provides support for any supplementary view kinds specified in the initializer.                    3. `-[UICollectionView setCollectionViewLayout:animated:completion]` has [serious known bugs][3] in iOS7 and does not provide any animation options. TLLayoutTransitioning provides a robust alternative to this API with support for animation duration, 30+ easing curves and content offset control. This is done by using `CADisplayLink` to drive an interactive `TLTransitionLayout` as a non-interactive animation.                    Check out the demos in the Examples workspace!                                        Changes in 1.0.8                    * Fix #23 "Exception during pinch gesture handling"

It also comes with extension view support!		                   # Purpose                   The purpose of writing this was to provide a super simple way to add the expansion/contraction UINavigationBar functionality, like the one found in facebook and instagram.                   It literally takes a single liner to get started and have your navigation bar expand/shrink based on the UIScrollView subclass that you attach to the designated object.                   In addition to the support for UINavigationBar, it also allows you to assign an extension view that will be managed for you, and that extension view is shown right below the navigation bar, and will expand/contract as well!                   The component has been carefully written, battle tested, and has more fine grain customization, like the tolerance range you want to hold off the expansion/contraction before applying the effect.                   Please read all about this component in the [github repo readme file](https://github.com/telly/TLYShyNavBar/blob/master/README.md).

Tml for Objective C is the most advanced translation solution for iOS applications.It reduces the number of steps required for translating an app to the absolute minimum. All you need to do is to include the Tml header file in your app, initialize the SDK and use the various translation macros to internationalize your content.The SDK comes with its own language selector, where users can switch languages. Or you can use the language set by the OS.It also comes with In-App Translator - where you can ask your users to help translate your app right from within your app.Tml SDK integrates with TranslationExchange.com service, where you can manage the entire translation process - add new languages, invite translators, manage phrases, and much more.Once the translations are done, they will be automatically downloaded and installed by the SDK in your app. Everything is done real-time - you DO NOT need to submit a new application to the App Store. You can simply enable a new language on TranslationExchange and it will immediately be available in your application.You can learn more about the SDK by visiting the project's GitHub page:        https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-objcor running sample applications:Demo app that comes with the SDK:    https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-objc/tree/master/ProjectWammer application that shows how the SDK can be integrated into a messaging app:    https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-objc-samples-wammer

You then add black pixels along the edges to indicate the stretchable region (inferred from the marks on the top and left edges) and information about the NinePatch padding (inferred from the marks on the bottom and right edges).More information here: this version is forked from the original by andy mcsherry (github@andylanddev.com) which fixed some issues.I simply forked from him and tagged a release.

Among other crazy features, iOS 7 enables users to have automatic updates for their apps, wiping away the infamous App Store badge. This is really convenient both for users and developers, but it comes with a couple of downsides:* users are not aware about the changes introduced in the latest update, unless they explicitly open the App Store page to check the release notes;* developers who spend their time working on well-written release notes lose their chance to inform and communicate with their users.## So what?TWSReleaseNotesView is a simple way to address those issues. It comes with a straightforward API which enables developers to show in-app release notes with a fully customizable popup view.

11565	TWTSideMenuViewController		881		171		https://github.com/twotoasters/TWTSideMenuViewController.git		Side Menus for iOS 7.		  One of the most common implementations of menu views has been the "Side Drawer", "basement", or "Side Menu" made popular in apps such as Facebook and Path. When the user taps to open the side menu the user's main context slides to the right (or left in some implementations) to display another view below. This works well in iOS 6 and before. What does it mean for iOS 7?  With iOS 7, apps are encouraged to use the whole screen and not rely on the 20pt status bar to be outside of the plane of your app. This breaks the existing side bar idea in that the status bar now lives over two view contexts with a single style.  Working with the team at Luvocracy, we needed to find a way to show a side menu for our iOS 7 release. Many designers on Dribbble began looking at a new approach for side bars. Inspired by this we worked up a quick prototype that slides the view to the right and scales revealing the menu as seen in the dribbble samples above. Moving forward from this idea and inspired by other ideas from iOS 7 we changed it from a slide to more of a viewport change.

UIImage Sprite Additions=============Useful UIImage category for handling sprite sheets. This add-on smoothes the way of extracting images from a sprite sheet (texture atlas).This can be useful in UIImageView animations where animationImages array has to be filled with a set of images representing frames. UIImage-Sprite category makes this process trivial by introducing two methods:	-(NSArray *)spritesWithSpriteSheetImage:(UIImage *)image spriteSize:(CGSize)size;	-(NSArray *)spritesWithSpriteSheetImage:(UIImage *)image inRange:(NSRange)range spriteSize:(CGSize)size;How to=======There are two methods in UIImage+Sprite category. First one:	-(NSArray *)spritesWithSpriteSheetImage:(UIImage *)image spriteSize:(CGSize)size;The method returns an array with UIImages. Original sprite sheet (image) is sliced into smaller chunks, each of the specified size. Second method is very similar:	-(NSArray *)spritesWithSpriteSheetImage:(UIImage *)image inRange:(NSRange)range spriteSize:(CGSize)size;This method does exactly the same thing as the latter. However, this time we can specify the range of the chunks we want to get.Note that for performance reasons you should not fire these methods every time you want to get the array of animation frames. You should rather fire it once and store the output array somewhere. This is because the Core Graphics image manipulation operations (especially on large images) are not so fast and your application may slow down.I wrote this add-on to facilitate the setup of short animations using UIImageView. For more complex animations I recommend using OpenGLES.  Demo=======SpriteAnimationDemo project presents the usage of the UIImage+Sprite methods. The example shows how to create an animated UIImageView. This cool explosion sprite sheet which I included in the demo can be found at http://gushh.net/blog/free-game-sprites-explosion-3/. I added some numbers to this image to make testing and debugging easier.

Copy the `/UIImage_ASWhiteColorToAlpha` directory into your project.2. Import UIImage+ASWhiteColorToAlpha.h `#import UIImage+ASWhiteColorToAlpha.h`3. Use -[UIImage imageWithWhiteColorToAlpha] method call to get your translucent image `UIImage *myTranslucentImage = [myOriginalImage imageWithWhiteColorToAlpha];` or -[UIImage renderImageWithWhiteColorToAlpha:] which gives back the asynchronously rendered image in a completion block.```__block UIImage *myTranslicentImage = nil;[myOriginalImage renderImageWithWhiteColorToAlpha:^(UIImage *translucentImage){myTranslucentImage = translucentImage;// Update UI}];```##Known issues* Should be cached for reuse

The UIImagePickerController class includes a parameter (allowsEditing) that lets the user move and scale the image and crop it to a square shape.									The info dictionary returned as part of the UIImagePickerControllerDelegate protocol includes an "edited" version of the image, but its resolution is limited to a relatively small size.									However, the dictionary also contains a pointer to the full-resolution image along with the the value for the UIImagePickerControllerCropRect key, which is a CGRect corresponding to the area selected by the user.									Unfortunately grabbing a chunk of a UIImage from the device camera is not completely trivial, as the image data is always stored in the device's native orientation with a flag indicating that it should be rotated before being displayed.									So a bit of low-level CoreGraphics-fu is required to rotate and translate the image before selecting the relevant area and drawing it to a CGContext.									This category on UIImage does that in order to create a cropped image at the maximum possible resolution.

Deprecated in favor of PureLayout: https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout		      Introducing [PureLayout](https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout)      ========================      ### UIView+AutoLayout has been deprecated in favor of [PureLayout](https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout), which includes OS X support!      			UIView+AutoLayout			=================			The ultimate API for iOS Auto Layout -- impressively simple, immensely powerful. Comprised of categories on `UIView`, `NSArray`, and `NSLayoutConstraint`.			UIView+AutoLayout provides a developer-friendly interface for the vast majority of Auto Layout use cases. It is designed for clarity and simplicity, taking inspiration from the Auto Layout UI options available in Interface Builder but delivering far more flexibility and capability. The API is also highly efficient, as it adds only a thin layer of third party code and is engineered for maximum performance (for example, by automatically adding constraints to the nearest ancestor view).			API Cheat Sheet			---------------			This is just a handy overview of the core API methods. Check out the [header file](https://github.com/smileyborg/UIView-AutoLayout/blob/master/Source/UIView%2BAutoLayout.h) for the full API and documentation. A couple notes:			*	*All of the API methods begin with `auto...` for easy autocompletion!*			*	*All methods that generate constraints also automatically add the constraint(s) to the correct view, then return the newly created constraint(s) for you to optionally store for later adjustment or removal.*			*	*Many methods below also have a variant which includes a `relation:` parameter to make the constraint an inequality.*			**`UIView`**			    + autoRemoveConstraint(s):			    - autoRemoveConstraintsAffectingView(AndSubviews)			    + autoSetPriority:forConstraints:			    - autoSetContent(CompressionResistance|Hugging)PriorityForAxis:			    - autoCenterInSuperview:			    - autoAlignAxisToSuperviewAxis:			    - autoPinEdgeToSuperviewEdge:withInset:			    - autoPinEdgesToSuperviewEdges:withInsets:(excludingEdge:)			    - autoPinEdge:toEdge:ofView:(withOffset:)			    - autoAlignAxis:toSameAxisOfView:(withOffset:)			    - autoMatchDimension:toDimension:ofView:(withOffset:|withMultiplier:)			    - autoSetDimension(s)ToSize:			    - autoConstrainAttribute:toAttribute:ofView:(withOffset:|withMultiplier:)			    - autoPinTo(Top|Bottom)LayoutGuideOfViewController:withInset:			**`NSArray`**			    - autoAlignViewsToEdge:			    - autoAlignViewsToAxis:			    - autoMatchViewsDimension:			    - autoSetViewsDimension:toSize:			    - autoDistributeViewsAlongAxis:withFixedSpacing:(insetSpacing:)alignment:			    - autoDistributeViewsAlongAxis:withFixedSize:(insetSpacing:)alignment:			**`NSLayoutConstraint`**			    - autoInstall			    - autoRemove

Based on Apples [Reachability](https://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/samplecode/Reachability/Introduction/Intro.html) project.                      ### Supported iOS SDK Versions                      * Supported build target - iOS 7.0                      ### ARC Compatibility                      VCLReachability works both with ARC.                      ## Table of contents                      - [Quick start](#quick-start)                      - [ChangeLog](#changelog)                      - [Documentation](#documentation)                      - [Bugs and feature requests](#bugs-and-feature-requests)                      - [Contributing](#contributing)                      - [Community](#community)                      - [Versioning](#versioning)                      - [Authors](#authors)                      - [License](#license)                      ## Quick start                      Four quick start options are available:                      - [Download the latest release](https://github.com/VerticodeLabs/VCLReachability/releases) and add the source from `Classes` to your project.                      - Clone the repo and use the example project:                       ```bash                      git@github.com:VerticodeLabs/VCLReachability.git                      ```                      - Install with [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) by adding VCLReachability to your Podfile.                      ```bash                      pod `VCLReachability`                      ```                      ### What's included                      Within the download you'll find the following files, providing both compiled and minified variations:                      ```                      Classes/                       ios/                           NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h                           NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.m                           VCLReachability.h                           VCLReachability.m                           VCLReachability.h                      Examples/                       ...                      Tests/                       ...                      VCLReachability.xcodeproj/                       ...                      ```                      ### Sample Usage                      IMPORTANT: VCLReachability must use DNS to resolve the host name before it can determine the VCLReachability of that host, and this may take time on certain network connections.  Because of this, the API will return NotReachable until name resolution has completed.  This delay may be visible in the interface on some networks.                      The VCLReachability sample demonstrates the asynchronous use of the SCNetworkReachability API. You can use the API synchronously, but do not issue a synchronous check by hostName on the main thread. If the device cannot reach a DNS server or is on a slow network, a synchronous call to the SCNetworkReachabilityGetFlags function can block for up to 30 seconds trying to resolve the hostName. If this happens on the main thread, the application watchdog will kill the application after 20 seconds of inactivity.                      SCNetworkReachability API's do not currently provide a means to detect support for GameKit peer-to-peer networking over Bluetooth.                      #### Using the VCLReachabilitySubscriber Protocol                      Add `VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h` to the class you which to become a reachability subscriber.                      ```objective-c                      #import "VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h"                      ```                      Implement the protocol method                      ```objective-c                      - (void)reachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note{...}                      - (void)wifiReachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note{...}                      - (void)internetReachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note{...}                      - (void)hostNameReachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note{...}                      ```                      For example....                      ```objective-c                      - (void)reachabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)note                      {                          VCLReachability* curReach = [note object];                          NSParameterAssert([curReach isKindOfClass:[VCLReachability class]]);                                                    [(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>)self updateWithReachability:curReach forType:nil];                      }                      ```                      #### Using the VCLReachability Category                      Add `NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h` to the class you which to become a reachability subscriber.                      ```objective-c                      #import "NSObject+VCLReachabilitySubscriber.h"                      ```                      The VCLReachabilitySubscriber protocol methods will aready be filled in. By default every subscriber will execute `- (void)updateWithReachability:(VCLReachability *)reachability forType:(NSString*)type;` unless the other optional protocol methods are defined. Be sure to define `updateWithReachability` in your subscriber.                      #### Subscribe to Network Events                      The following methods are used to subscribe to differente reachability events.                      ```objective-c                      /*!                       * Subscribe change it network events                       */                      + (void)subscribeToReachabilityNotificationsWithDelegate:(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>) delegate;                      + (void)subscribeToReachabilityForWifiWithDelegate:(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>) delegate;                      + (void)subscribeToReachabilityForHostNameWithName:(NSString *)hostName delegate:(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>) delegate;                      + (void)subscribeToReachabilityForInternetConnectionWithDelegate:(id<VCLReachabilitySubscriber>) delegate;                      ```                      For example...                      ```objective-c                      - (void)viewDidLoad                      {                            [VCLReachability subscribeToReachabilityForHostNameWithName:@"google.com" delegate:self];                          [VCLReachability subscribeToReachabilityForInternetConnectionWithDelegate:self];                          [VCLReachability subscribeToReachabilityForWifiWithDelegate:self];                      }                      ```                      **NOTE**                      Make sure you unsubscribe your delegates before they go bad by using the VCLReachability classes unsubscribe methods. I suggest that you do this within `dealloc`.                      ## ChangeLog                      Refer to the [releases](https://github.com/VerticodeLabs/VCLReachability/releases) section for a detailed ChangeLog                      <!-- ## Documentation                      Refer to [vclreachability.readthedocs.org](http://vclreachability.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for detailed API documentation. -->                      ## Bugs and feature requests                      Have a bug or a feature request?

Simple grid layout for UICollectionView with sticky headers.					Vertical scrolling.										##Note about iOS7					The original intent of this library was to fix a multitude of					animation issues with `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` and batch updates 					in iOS6. The "Expand" and "Sort & Filter" sample projects illustrate					two such issues with side-by-side comparisons of `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`					and `VCollectionViewGridLayout`. Note that in iOS7, both of these sample					projects work correctly with `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`, so this library					may not provide any benefit over `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` beyond					sticky headers.

In iOS 7, Apple introduced the possibility to [execute JavaScript via the JavaScriptCore JavaScript engine]                        (http://nshipster.com/javascriptcore/). Unfortunately, JavaScriptCore is missing some objects and functions a browser                        JavaScript environment would have. Especially the methods described in the [WindowTimers specification]                        (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#windowtimers), such as `setTimeout` or `setInterval` are not                        provided. This library implements those methods, so it is possible to use JavaScript libraries which were originally                        developed for in-browser use in your Objective-C (or Swift) application without the need to use a hidden WebView.

12857	zipzap		875		134		https://github.com/pixelglow/ZipZap.git		ZipZap is a zip file I/O library for Mac OS X and iOS.		The zip file is an ideal container for compound Objective-C documents. Zip files are widely used and well understood. You can randomly access their parts. The format compresses decently and has extensive operating system and tool support. So we want to make this format an even easier choice for you. Thus, the library features:- Easy-to-use interface: The public API offers just three classes! Yet you can look through zip files using familiar NSArray collections and properties. And you can zip, unzip and rezip zip files through familiar NSData, NSStream and Image I/O classes.- Efficient implementation: We've optimized zip file reading and writing to reduce virtual memory pressure and disk file thrashing. Depending on how your compound document is organized, updating a single entry can be faster than writing the same data to a separate file.- File format compatibility: Since ZipZap closely follows the zip file format specification, it is works with most Mac, Linux and Windows zip tools.
